# VueToast

## Type of Component
Vue Component - https://v1.vuejs.org/guide/components.html

## Installation

```bash
npm install @intus/vue-toast --save
```

## Purpose
This provides a jQuery Toastr style alert system

# Usage

When instantiating your component, it is extremely important to bind a Vue instance to the parentInstance attribute, as that instance will be the instance that has the $toast method bound to it, by which you will call toasts.

```html
<vue-toast :max-width="maxWidth" :delay="delay" :parent-instance="this"></vue-toast>
```

## Configuration
Various Vue Component Props have been exposed for customizing the behavior of the component.

Special note: camelCase props need to be converted to kebab-case when being set.
