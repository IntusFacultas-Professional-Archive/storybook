# Welcome to IFC Storybook

This storybook documents and tests all components that you could reasonably use for any NASIC application. 

## Installation 

You can install the component library this storybook is for with `npm install @intusfacultas/component-library@latest` or `yarn add @intusfacultas/componentlibrary@latest`

## Component Development Paradigm

Components here are split into 2 types of components.

<ul>
  <li>Presentational</li>
  <li>Container</li>
</ul>

## Presentational

Presentational components are concerned only with the displaying of data to the UI and allowing the user to interact
with the data.

They don't concern themselves with data fetching, data validation, or data mutation. They receive the data through
props, have their behavior configured through props and slots, and pass all events back up to <b>Container</b>
components.

## Container

Container components are concerned only with the fetching, validation, and mutation of data. They defer displaying
the data to their child <b>Presentational</b> components. Container components are hooked into a Vuex store.

They listen to events bubbling up from their child <b>Presentational</b> components for detecting when the user wishes
to mutate data.
