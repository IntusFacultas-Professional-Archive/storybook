# Theming

## Background

This component library is agnostic to any framework. All the styling is done in vanilla SCSS. However there are a few
important gotchas you need to be aware of.

1. Every component is responsible for importing _only_ its own styling. What this means is that if you import a
   component that uses _another_ component, the dependency will not have its styling imported by default. We explain how
   to solve this below.
2. For maintainers of this project, you will notice that there are SCSS files separate from every Vue SFC which get
   imported into the Vue SFC. This is intentional, and you should continue to follow this convention to avoid having your
   components fail to load styling due to point 1.

### Loading Dependency Styling.

There are two ways to solve the problem of dependency styling being unloaded. The first is the **recommended** way,
the second is a more labor intensive way that results in a slightly smaller production bundle.

1. The easiest way is to import `IFCThemeProvider` and wrap your project in the theme provider. We talk more about
   what this does further down, but the short and sweet version is that the ThemeProvider provides a SCSS file that has
   all the SCSS files for all the components imported, so no matter which component you import, the ThemeProvider will have
   styling for it and all it's dependencies.
2. If you want to avoid having to import the ThemeProvider (for example, because you don't intend to use many components
   and feel that it would be a waste to have the ThemeProvider import the rest of the SCSS for the rest of the components,
   you can manully import each additional dependency component that your main components need, as importing them will also
   `import` their styling.)

## IFCThemeProvider

The IFCThemeProvider does two important jobs.

1. It binds a class to itself `theme--default` or `theme--dark` to toggle dark mode and light mode (how this is
   implemented will be discussed below). All descendent components draw the styling based on whether they are a child of
   `theme--default` or `theme--dark`.
2. It imports every single component's SCSS into its own SCSS file that gets transpiled for use into one big CSS file,
   ensuring that all components and their dependencies have their styling present.

### How Dark Mode and Light Mode works.

In the `_colors.scss` partial file, there is a map that contains two themes, `default` and `dark`. The themes _must_
be symmetrical to avoid issues, but there is no way for me to programmatically enforce that. **You** as the maintainer
must be disciplined and keep that consistent. When a component wants to style itself with a color that is dark mode or
light mode theme dependent, it utilizes a mixin `themed()` that is defined in the same file, which causes the styling to
be depedent on the active theme (essentially it does something like `.theme--default .ThemedComponent {color: black})`
and `.theme--dark .ThemedComponent {color: white}` in the CSS)

The `themed()` mixin provides access to a SCSS `function` called `retrieveColor` which a consumer downstream uses to
retrieve a color from the currently active map (default or dark). At transpile time, the retrieveColor generates two
stylings as demonstrated above, branched by default and dark. This allows the entire styling to change just based on
the ThemeProvider, without having to change classes for all descendent components.

### How to use the ThemeProvider

```html
<template>
  <IFCThemeProvider :dark="dark">
    <!-- Your Project In Here -->
  </IFCThemeProvider>
</template>

<script>
  import { IFCThemeProvider } from "@intusfacultas/component-library/build/index.esm";
  export default {
    components: {
      IFCThemeProvider,
    },
    data() {
      return {
        dark: false, // toggle to true for dark mode
      };
    },
  };
</script>
```

### Developing your own components.

When you're developing your components, I'd recommend keeping several things in mind.

1. Consider whether colors are dark mode dependent or shared by more than one component. If so, add them to the
   `_colors.scss` partial, and import the partial at the top of the Vue SFC style tag as such:

```html
<style lang="scss">
  @use '../relative/path/to/_colors.scss' as colors;

  .MyClass {
    color: colors.$MyCustomColor;
    @include colors.themed() {
      background-color: colors.retrieveColor(
        "backgroud"
      ); // This is dark mode dependent!
    }
  }
</style>
```

2. Don't write SCSS inside of the `<style>` tag in your Vue SFC unless you intend for it only to be loaded if the
   component itself is loaded directly by the developer consuming this library. (there are valid reasons to do this.
   For example, the NASIC Link Navbar adds a margin to the body in IE when the component is loaded, but it doesn't make
   sense to have that margin present when the LINK Navbar isn't present to fill that margin, so that exists only in the `<style>` tag.)

Instead you should write a separate `MyComponent.scss` file which you can then `@import` into your Vue SFC `<style>`
area. The reason you should do this is because you'll also want to import your scss file in the `ThemeProvider/theme.scss`
file so that components that use your component as a dependency have your component style loaded by ThemeProvider.
